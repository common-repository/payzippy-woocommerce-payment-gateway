== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= It works only for Credit Cards. What about other methods? =

Since the payment gateway is still not complete from Payzippy's side, the currently supported method is credit card only. As soon as the payment gateway becomes ready the plugin will be updated.

= There is only SHA256 encryption but no MD5. Why? =

Since SHA256 is a better method over MD5, we directly used it rather than providing a choice. We chose the better one for you and stripped off the less secure one.

= All I can see is Redirect mode. What about the Iframe mode? =

That's scheduled for the next release. Stay tuned.

= Where can I find more support? =
